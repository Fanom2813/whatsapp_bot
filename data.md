About Babu Motors Uganda Limited, how it works , how it helps people, and how to the dto or drive to own program works
Babu Motors Uganda Limited, established in October 2019 and officially registered under number 80020002154719, is a reputable company in Uganda. Under the leadership of CEO Mr. Naveed Ahmed, Babu Motors has built a strong reputation in the vehicle leasing sector. Their flagship offering, the “Drive to Own” program, has empowered hundreds of Ugandans to transition from leasing vehicles to full ownership, helping them achieve financial independence and take charge of their futures.
The program primarily targets young people, providing them with opportunities to own and operate vehicles in Uganda’s vibrant transport sector. This includes services like tourism, school transport, and ride-hailing (Uber, Bolt, and SafeCar), among others. The vehicles leased through Babu Motors offer a pathway to earning a livelihood, paying school fees, and supporting families, significantly improving the lives of beneficiaries.
How the “Drive to Own” Program Works
The Drive-To-Own (DTO) program is a flexible vehicle ownership model by Babu Motors
Uganda. It allows customers to acquire a vehicle by paying a small initial deposit and
completing the balance through manageable weekly or monthly installments. It is not a loan
or hire-purchase, but a friendly, progressive leasing plan. Once all installments are
completed, the vehicle becomes fully yours.

understood perfectly. we’ll revise the answer to focus on attracting the client-by making the deposit sound like a straightforward step toward ownership, without getting into technicalities like whether it’s counted in installments. here's the updated version of q3:


Application Process and how to apply for the "Drive to Own" program and get a vehicle or a car with the required documents:
Prospective customers can explore the “Drive to Own” program via Babu Motors’ platforms, including TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, and the "Drive to Own" app on the Google Play Store. To begin the application process, customers should visit the Babu Motors office in Najjera 1, opposite Stabex Petrol Station, near Najjera Police Station.
The application process consists of the following steps:
Initial Inquiry
Prospective customers can inquire via phone, in person, or through the app, where Babu Motors staff will provide initial details.
Filling the Application Form
Interested individuals must complete an application form, specifying their preferred vehicle. 
Applicants must submit the following documents:
Required Documents:
A copy of the driver’s license
A copy of the National ID
A Local Council (LC) letter from the local chairman
Two guarantors who are familiar with the applicant
Two passport-sized photos
Two local phone numbers (Airtel and MTN Uganda)
An email address
A non-refundable application fee of UGX 300,000 is required.
A security deposit depending on the vehicle type.
After submitting the required documents and security deposit, Babu Motors initiates a verification process, which typically takes 3-5 working days.
Vehicle Selection
Once verification is complete, applicants are invited to choose from available vehicles. If their first choice is not available, they can inspect other options or wait for new stock. Babu Motors encourages customers to consult with their mechanics before making a final decision.
Agreement Signing
After vehicle selection, the beneficiary signs an operating lease agreement, witnessed by the guarantors. Legal advice is recommended before signing to ensure clarity of terms and conditions.
Payment and Progress Monitoring
Babu Motors provides a custom mobile app and website for easy payment tracking. Beneficiaries can make payments, monitor their progress, and receive updates throughout the leasing process. Clear communication is maintained to ensure a smooth experience.
Customer Support and Guidance
Babu Motors is committed to providing exceptional customer support throughout the leasing journey. The team is always available to answer questions and guide beneficiaries through the program. Beneficiaries are encouraged to reach out for clarification or assistance at any point during the process.

Lease Agreement and Payment Terms, how much to pay weekly or monthly, and how the payments work:
Vehicle Lease Terms:
Beneficiaries will enter into a lease agreement for a specific period, and they are required to make regular weekly payments to cover the vehicle cost.
Payment options for the program are as follows:
300K UGX per week: Lease period of 3 years and 3 months.
350K UGX per week: Lease period of 2 years and 8 months.
400K UGX per week: Lease period of 2 years and 2 months.
Early Payment Option:
Beneficiaries who wish to settle their lease before the agreed period can pay more than their weekly payment, reducing the duration of the lease. The calculations are structured to allow the beneficiary to own the vehicle faster, provided they make higher weekly payments.
The standard daily profit for Babu Motors is 17,000 UGX per vehicle, regardless of the weekly payment amount. This profit is added to the total cost of the vehicle.
Example of early payment:
If the vehicle is valued at 35M UGX, the security deposit of 8M UGX is deducted, leaving 27M UGX. If a beneficiary pays 29M UGX in the next 100 days, the beneficiary will have cleared the vehicle in that time.
Payment Breakdown:
The 17,000 UGX daily profit applies to every vehicle, regardless of the specific payment schedule.
Payments are calculated and recorded to ensure transparency, and beneficiaries can use the system to track their payments and progress.
Payment Methods
Method 1: Standard Payment Plan (Fixed Weekly Payments)
Under this method, beneficiaries are required to pay weekly at one of the following options:
300,000 UGX per week
350,000 UGX per week
400,000 UGX per week
These options correspond to different lease terms:
300,000 UGX per week: Pay off the vehicle in approximately 3 years and 3 months.
350,000 UGX per week: Pay off the vehicle in approximately 2 years and 8 months.
400,000 UGX per week: Pay off the vehicle in approximately 2 years and 2 months.
A customized mobile app is in place to support customers, providing detailed information about their payments, vehicle status, and progress toward ownership.
In the event that the beneficiary pays off the vehicle earlier than the agreed lease period, they may be entitled to a refund from their security deposit:
For those who finish paying the vehicle in less than 2 years, 2 million UGX from the security deposit will be refunded.
If the lease period extends beyond 2 years, no refund will be provided from the security deposit.
Method 2: Flexible Payment Plan (Pay as You Go)
This method allows beneficiaries to pay the balance on the vehicle as fast as they can. Here is how it works:
The total market value of the car is fixed (e.g., 30 million UGX for the Toyota Seienta).
The security deposit paid by the beneficiary (e.g., 6 million UGX) is recorded.
The 2 million UGX used for additional costs (insurance, VAT, GPS tracker, etc.) is deducted, leaving 4 million UGX as the remaining security deposit.
For example:
If a beneficiary takes the Toyota Seienta, which has a market value of 30 million UGX, they will pay a security deposit of 6 million UGX.
2 million UGX is used for the additional operational costs for the next 365 days.
4 million UGX remains as security deposit.
If the beneficiary chooses to pay off the vehicle faster, for instance, within 300 days:
Total paid in 300 days = 43,000 UGX daily * 300 days = 12.9 million UGX.
The balance remaining on the vehicle’s market value is calculated as:
Market value = 30 million UGX
Security deposit after deducting 2 million UGX for costs = 4 million UGX.
Remaining car value = 30 million UGX - 4 million UGX = 26 million UGX.
Amount paid so far (12.9 million UGX) = 12.9 million UGX is subtracted from 26 million UGX, leaving 13.1 million UGX.
Calculating the Additional Profit
After this, the company profit of 17,000 UGX per day must be added:
17,000 UGX/day * 300 days = 5.1 million UGX.
This makes the total amount remaining for the beneficiary to pay:
Remaining value (13.1 million UGX) + Profit (5.1 million UGX) = 18.2 million UGX.
The beneficiary now has the option to pay 18.2 million UGX on the spot, and if they do, they will be granted ownership of the vehicle immediately.
Over 365 Days (Entering 2nd Year)
If the beneficiary has not paid off the car within 365 days and continues payments into the second year, additional costs will apply.
2 million UGX can be either deducted from the remaining security deposit or added to the total amount still due, depending on how the beneficiary wishes to proceed.
Additional 17,000 UGX per day will continue to accrue for every day the payment remains outstanding, as part of the company’s profit.
Security Deposit Refunds (Flexible Plan)
Refund Process: In the flexible payment method, if the beneficiary pays off the car in less than 365 days, the company will refund the balance of the security deposit after deducting 2 million UGX used for additional costs. The balance of the security deposit is refunded after deducting any amounts owed.
For example, after 300 days, if the beneficiary paid 12.9 million UGX, the remaining value is calculated, and the company adds the daily profit for 300 days, giving the total to be paid. The beneficiary is then given the ownership if the full amount is paid.
Payment Flexibility: Beneficiaries are free to make additional payments or pay off the vehicle earlier than the standard lease terms. The earlier the payments are made, the less they will end up paying in profit (17,000 UGX daily).
Late Payments: Failure to pay on time may result in additional charges. The beneficiary is responsible for any outstanding amounts, including the daily profit, and the payment will accrue accordingly.
Refunds and Ownership: Beneficiaries can choose the flexible payment plan, where the remaining security deposit will be refunded after deducting the operational costs, and they can take ownership as soon as they complete payments.
This detailed breakdown should clarify the different payment methods and terms for all beneficiaries, giving them a transparent view of their payment obligations and options. All the calculations and profit deductions are set to ensure clarity for both current and future beneficiaries of the Babu Motors Drive to Own Program.

Got it! Below is the updated and detailed information on what happens if a beneficiary can no longer continue with their lease agreement, and how the process works when transferring the lease to another person:
Babu Motors: Drive to Own Program – Lease Transfer and Refunds
What Happens If a Beneficiary Can No Longer Continue with the Lease Agreement?
In certain circumstances, a beneficiary may find themselves unable to continue with their lease agreement. When this happens, the following options are available:
Refunds and Security Deposit:
If the beneficiary has paid 12.9 million UGX in 300 days, and has paid a 10 million UGX security deposit, the following refund process applies:
The company does not refund the minimum rent of 43,000 UGX per day, as this is part of the company’s ongoing profit for the vehicle.
However, from the security deposit, the beneficiary can receive a refund of 8 million UGX, since 2 million UGX has already been used for additional operational costs like insurance, VAT, GPS tracker, etc.

Why Security Deposit? What is Security Deposit, and how much is it?:
The security deposit is required to cover certain vehicle-related costs such as insurance, taxes, GPS installation, vehicle evaluations, and other operational costs. This deposit varies based on the market value of the vehicle.
The deposit is utilized for insurance and operational costs, and any remaining portion is deducted from the total cost of the vehicle.
Price Adjustment and Payment Methods
In the Babu Motors Drive to Own Program, different vehicles have different market values, and therefore, their security deposits may vary. Here are some examples:
Toyota Seienta: Market value = 30 million UGX; Security deposit = 6 million UGX.
Toyota Wish: Market value = 35 million UGX; Security deposit = 8 million UGX.
Toyota Noah: Market value = 43 million UGX; Security deposit = 10 million UGX.
Price Adjustment Process
When a beneficiary takes a vehicle, there may be a price adjustment based on the market value of the vehicle. The price adjustment is handled as follows:
Toyota Noah: The security deposit of 10 million UGX is split. 6 million UGX is recorded as the security deposit, while the remaining 4 million UGX is considered as the price adjustment.
Toyota Wish: The security deposit of 8 million UGX is split. 6 million UGX is recorded as the security deposit, and the remaining 2 million UGX is considered as the price adjustment.
Toyota Seienta: The full 6 million UGX paid as security deposit is recorded. This is because vehicles with a market value of 30 million UGX or lower require a fixed security deposit of 6 million UGX. This deposit covers additional operational costs, including insurance and other associated fees for the first 365 days.
Security Deposit is an upfront payment made by the beneficiary, which is used to cover various services and expenses such as:
Comprehensive insurance.
Value Added Tax (VAT).
GPS Tracker installation.
Vehicle evaluation and transaction fees.
Any unpaid fees will be deducted from the security deposit.
After the vehicle is returned or ownership is transferred, any remaining balance from the security deposit will be refunded to the beneficiary.
Important Considerations for Beneficiaries
Prohibited Activities:
Vehicles under the Drive to Own program must not be used for criminal activities, including but not limited to theft, robbery, or illegal transactions.
If the vehicle is found to be used in such activities, Babu Motors reserves the right to immediately impound the vehicle and terminate the lease agreement.
Tampering with GPS:
Tampering with the GPS tracker installed on the vehicle is a serious offense and will result in immediate impoundment of the vehicle.
If the GPS is removed or disabled, it will be treated as bad intent and can result in severe penalties or loss of the vehicle.
Payment Methods
Payments can be made via MTN or Airtel mobile money, as Babu Motors' system is integrated with these platforms.
We do not encourage other payment methods due to transparency and tracking issues.

Insurance, Repairs, and Responsibilities of the Beneficiary
Insurance Requirement:
All beneficiaries are required to cover the insurance costs of the vehicle, which includes comprehensive coverage. This is mandatory and must be arranged before taking possession of the vehicle. Babu Motors facilitates this through a partnership with NIC General Insurance.
In case of an accident, the beneficiary is advised to directly contact the insurance company for the claims process. Babu Motors offers guidance via Madam Esthar (+256702775433) if the vehicle has comprehensive insurance with NIC.
Steps to follow in case of an accident:
Report the accident to the nearest police station immediately.
Take clear photos of the entire vehicle, including all damaged areas, the chassis number, and the number plate.
Send the photos to both the insurance company and your field manager.
Obtain quotes for repairs from at least two garages, ensuring that repair costs are reasonable.
Do not repair the vehicle until you have received authorization from the insurance company, as they may wish to send an assessor to evaluate the damage.
Once repairs are completed, the vehicle should be brought to Babu Motors for inspection and removed from the garage as soon as possible to avoid delays in payment.
Responsibility for Vehicle Maintenance:
The beneficiary is fully responsible for all maintenance and repair costs. Babu Motors is not responsible for any repairs.
If the vehicle gets damaged due to accidents or misuse, the beneficiary is responsible for covering the costs of repairs that are not covered by insurance.
If the vehicle is involved in a criminal activity and is impounded by the police, the beneficiary is responsible for all legal and repair-related costs.

GPS Tracking & Vehicle Security:
All vehicles are equipped with GPS trackers to prevent theft and monitor vehicle usage.
Tampering with the GPS tracker will lead to the immediate impoundment of the vehicle and may result in penalties.
Legal & Financial Implications:
Babu Motors does not allow vehicles to be used for illegal activities (e.g., theft, robbery) or to be mortgaged to money lenders.
Any violations of the terms of the agreement can lead to the termination of the lease agreement and vehicle impoundment.

Non-Payment, if you dont pay or delay payments or miss payments and Late Charges
Late Payment Charges:
If the beneficiary does not make a payment on time, a 0.5% daily late charge is applied to the outstanding amount. This helps deter late payments and encourages timely payment.
Example of Late Payment:
If the weekly payment of 300K UGX is missed, the beneficiary’s wallet will show a negative balance of 300K UGX and will incur a 1,500 UGX late fee on the following day.
The charges will keep accumulating daily, and after several weeks, the wallet can become highly negative.
Impounding of the Vehicle:
If the beneficiary’s wallet remains negative and exceeds 1M UGX in arrears, Babu Motors reserves the right to impound the vehicle.
Within Kampala: The beneficiary will be charged an impounding fee of 300K UGX.
Outside Kampala: The impounding fee will be 300K UGX, plus transportation costs, fuel charges, and other related expenses. The beneficiary must pay all associated costs.
Vehicle Recovery:
Once a vehicle is impounded, the beneficiary has 14 days to pay all outstanding arrears and charges to recover the vehicle. If the beneficiary does not pay within the specified time, Babu Motors may proceed with further actions.
Outstanding Payment Calculation:
If the vehicle is impounded, Babu Motors will assess:
The total amount paid by the beneficiary to date.
The remaining balance.
Any fines, impounding charges, or repair costs.
The security deposit and the vehicle’s depreciation.
Example:
If a Toyota Noah valued at 42M UGX has been used for 300 days, and the beneficiary has paid 11.7M UGX, the outstanding balance will be calculated based on the remaining balance and the days used.
Any penalties for late payments and repairs are deducted from the security deposit.

Crime and Misuse of Vehicles
Use of Vehicle for Illegal Activities:
If a vehicle is used in any criminal activity (e.g., theft, robbery), the lease agreement will be terminated immediately, and the vehicle will be impounded. The beneficiary will bear the full responsibility for any legal consequences and damage caused.
Vehicles cannot be mortgaged or pledged to financial institutions or illegal lenders during the lease period. Any such act will result in immediate termination of the agreement.

Consequences of Vehicle Tampering
Tampering with GPS Tracker:
Each vehicle under the Drive-to-Own program is equipped with a GPS tracker. Tampering or removing the tracker is considered a serious offense and will lead to immediate impounding of the vehicle. This is treated as bad intention, and the beneficiary may face significant penalties or may lose the vehicle entirely.

Driving Conduct and Safety
Driving Carefully:
Beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to drive responsibly. This includes:
Avoiding speeding.
Ensuring that they do not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Having a valid driver’s license at all times.
Failure to adhere to these driving rules can result in accidents, which not only lead to repair costs but also affect the vehicle's value and the beneficiary’s payments.
Impact of Accidents on Payment Terms:
In case of accidents, the beneficiary will be held responsible for any repair costs not covered by insurance. Some accidents may result in the vehicle losing value, and the insurance might cover less than the repair cost. In such cases, the beneficiary must pay the difference.

General Advice to Beneficiaries
Make Payments On Time:
It’s crucial for beneficiaries to make their payments on time to avoid penalties, late charges, and the risk of vehicle impoundment.
Regular Vehicle Maintenance:
Keeping the vehicle in good condition is the responsibility of the beneficiary. Regular maintenance ensures the vehicle retains its value, avoids mechanical issues, and is not subject to costly repairs.
Communication:
Beneficiaries are encouraged to maintain open communication with Babu Motors and inform us immediately in case of any issues, such as accidents, repairs, or potential late payments.

Transfer of Lease Agreement to Another Beneficiary:
If the beneficiary can no longer continue with the lease, we allow them to transfer the lease agreement to a friend or relative under certain conditions:
Conditions for Lease Transfer:
Written Agreement: The current beneficiary and the new beneficiary must come to an agreement regarding the payment terms and other conditions of the lease. This agreement should be in writing and should be presented to Babu Motors for approval.
Full Disclosure: The current beneficiary must explain the circumstances that prevent them from continuing with the lease and must also disclose what they have agreed upon with the new beneficiary. This ensures full transparency and avoids any misunderstandings.
Approval by Babu Motors: The transfer will only be approved if the new beneficiary meets all our verification requirements. This includes submitting the necessary documentation, such as identification, proof of residence, and any other required paperwork.
Verification Fee: The new beneficiary will be required to pay a 300,000 UGX verification fee, which covers the cost of processing the lease transfer.
Verification Process: Once the documents and fee are submitted, Babu Motors will conduct a thorough verification process to ensure that the new beneficiary is eligible for the lease transfer.
Additional Terms for Lease Transfer:
Additional Weeks for the New Beneficiary:
If the lease is transferred, the remaining term of the lease will be adjusted. For example:
If the original beneficiary had signed for 168 weeks and has already paid for 100 weeks, there will be 68 weeks remaining on their original lease.
Upon transfer of the lease, Babu Motors will add 4 more weeks to the new beneficiary’s remaining term.
In this example, the new beneficiary will be required to pay for 72 weeks in total (68 weeks remaining + 4 additional weeks).
The new beneficiary will take over the remaining payments based on the agreed payment schedule, which may be the same as the original lease terms or modified based on their agreement.
Important Notes Regarding Lease Transfer:
Transparency is Key: It is important that all parties involved are completely honest and transparent in the lease transfer process. No hidden information should be shared, and the transfer will only occur with full disclosure and the proper documentation.

what happens to vehicles returned after 6 months or 1 year, along with details about their reconditioning and the updated lease terms for new applicants:
Babu Motors: Drive to Own Program – Handling Returned Vehicles
What Happens to Cars Returned After 6 Months or 1 Year?
At Babu Motors, we understand that sometimes beneficiaries may need to return a vehicle before completing the full lease term. In such cases, vehicles returned after 6 months or 1 year are processed and made available for new applicants. The process involves:
Reconditioning the Vehicle:
When a car is returned, it is sent to our garage for inspection, reconditioning, and maintenance. This is to ensure that the vehicle meets the quality standards required for future use.
The reconditioning process includes checks on the engine, bodywork, interior, and safety features, as well as any necessary repairs. We also perform routine maintenance such as oil changes, tire rotations, and brake checks to ensure the vehicle is in good working order for the next beneficiary.
Once the vehicle passes inspection and all necessary repairs are completed, it is then made available for new applicants who are interested in leasing a vehicle through our Drive to Own program.
Updated Lease Terms for Returned Vehicles:
Reduced Security Deposit: Returned vehicles often come with a reduced security deposit compared to new vehicles. This is because the vehicle has already been in use for a certain period and has depreciated in value. The deposit amount is adjusted accordingly to reflect the vehicle's market value and condition.
For example, a Toyota Noah, initially requiring a 10 million UGX deposit, might require a reduced deposit (e.g., 8 million UGX) once it has been returned and reconditioned.
Reduced Lease Term: Vehicles that have been returned after 6 months or 1 year will typically have a shorter lease term than new vehicles. The number of weeks or years will be adjusted based on how long the vehicle has already been in use.
For instance, if a car was originally leased for 3.3 years (around 168 weeks), but it is returned after 1 year of use, the remaining lease term will be recalculated to reflect the reduced time.
This will result in a shorter overall lease term for the new beneficiary who leases the vehicle.


Lease Terms for New Applicants:
New applicants leasing a vehicle that has been previously returned will be subject to the adjusted lease terms, including:
Lower Security Deposit: A reduced deposit based on the current market value of the vehicle.
Shorter Lease Term: The number of weeks or months in the lease agreement will be reduced to reflect the time the vehicle has already been leased.
Adjusted Weekly Payments: Depending on the reconditioned vehicle's value and the adjusted lease terms, the weekly payment amounts may also be reduced. The payment terms will be clearly outlined in the new agreement for the applicant.
Differences Between Vehicles:
Each vehicle has unique circumstances, including mileage, age, condition, and market value, which influence the adjusted security deposit, lease term, and weekly payments.
For example:
A Toyota Seinta (market value 30 million UGX) might have a reduced deposit of 5 million UGX after being returned, and a lease term of 2.5 years (reduced from the original 3.3 years).
A Toyota Wish (market value 35 million UGX) might have a deposit reduction to 7 million UGX and an adjusted lease term of 2.7 years.

Impounding Process
Up to UGX 1 million in arrears: Babu Motors will send reminders via SMS, phone calls, email, and app notifications. Field agents may visit to remind the beneficiary to make payments.
Arrears exceeding UGX 1 million: Field managers will locate and impound the vehicle. The beneficiary will be required to pay an impound fee of UGX 300,000 (within Kampala) or more if the vehicle is outside Kampala. Additional charges like fuel, transportation, and accommodation will be the beneficiary's responsibility.
Example: If a vehicle is impounded in Gulu (Northern Uganda), the impounding fee will be UGX 300,000, with additional costs for transport, fuel, and other expenses, making the total UGX 1.7 million.
Vehicle Pickup After Impounding
If the vehicle is impounded, the beneficiary is required to pay all outstanding amounts within 14 days from the date of impounding.
If the beneficiary does not retrieve the vehicle within this time, late charges will continue to accrue on the outstanding amount.
After 14 days, Babu Motors may issue a demand notice and, after no response, proceed with the closure of the file.
Calculation of Deductions from Security Deposit In the case of impoundment, deductions are made from the security deposit, which may include:
Arrears
Impoundment fees (UGX 300,000 or more depending on location)
Additional charges (e.g., fuel, accommodation, repairs, fines)
Outstanding rental fees (e.g., UGX 43,000 per day for the number of days the vehicle was used)
Any repair costs required for the vehicle.
Example: If a Toyota Noah has been with the beneficiary for 300 days and the total unpaid rent is UGX 12.9 million, and the beneficiary has made payments totaling UGX 11.7 million, the difference of UGX 1.2 million will be deducted from the security deposit. Other deductions, such as impounding fees, fines, and repairs, will be added to this amount.
If the total amount due after deductions is higher than the security deposit, the beneficiary must pay the difference.
GPS Tracking Tampering
Any tampering with the GPS tracking device installed in the vehicle is a serious offense. This is regarded as a breach of the lease agreement and can lead to immediate impoundment of the vehicle. Babu Motors will not return the vehicle if tampering is detected.
Final Calculation and Refund
If the beneficiary decides to part ways with the vehicle before the 365-day period, Babu Motors will perform a final calculation based on the number of days the vehicle was used and the amount paid:
The total days the vehicle was used will be multiplied by the daily rent (UGX 43,000) to determine the total amount owed.
Deductions for any arrears, repairs, fines, or additional charges (like impounding) will be subtracted from the security deposit.
If there is any remaining amount from the security deposit after all deductions, it will be refunded to the beneficiary.



Early Payment Option
For customers who want to pay off their vehicle faster and save on long-term costs, we also offer an early payment option. This option is designed to give you the flexibility to pay off your vehicle as quickly as you want, based on the remaining balance after your security deposit.
Example: Early Payment Calculation
Let’s break it down using a Toyota Wish as an example:
Market Value: 35,000,000 UGX
Security Deposit: 8,000,000 UGX
Additional Costs (2M for insurance, taxes, etc.): 2,000,000 UGX
After deducting 2M for the additional running costs, the remaining balance you owe on the vehicle would be 6,000,000 UGX (8M deposit - 2M = 6M).
To calculate how much you would need to pay to clear the remaining balance quickly:
The remaining balance on the vehicle is 29,000,000 UGX (35M - 6M).
If you choose to pay this balance in 100 days, you would need to pay 290,000 UGX per day (29M ÷ 100 days).
Babu Motors’ Daily Profit: 17,000 UGX per vehicle, which is our standard daily profit across all vehicles. This covers our operational costs, including the cost of buying the vehicles, paying taxes, salaries, rent, and other business expenses.
Quick Payment Advantage:
The faster you pay, the less expensive your overall vehicle cost becomes. By paying more upfront, you reduce the overall amount of interest you would pay over the term of your lease.
If you’re able to pay faster (for example, making larger weekly payments or paying daily), you can finish your agreement early and save on the total cost of the vehicle.
Example of Faster Payment:
If you want to pay off your vehicle faster, you could opt to pay 400,000 UGX per week, which would allow you to complete your payments in approximately 2 years and 2 months, as compared to 3.3 years with the regular weekly payment option. By doing so, you save time and money on interest.
Why is the Total Lease Cost Higher Than the Car’s Market Value?
Some people may look at the total amount they will pay by the end of their lease (for example, 50,400,000 UGX for a vehicle valued at 35,000,000 UGX) and think it’s too high.
This total cost includes:
17,000 UGX per day as Babu Motors’ daily profit: This covers the cost of running our business, including the investment we made in buying the vehicle, paying interest to banks, covering operational costs like salaries and rent, and handling vehicle depreciation.
Market Conditions: In Uganda, inflation and the fluctuating value of the Ugandan shilling also play a role in how much we need to charge to cover our operational costs.
Flexibility: The option to pay faster helps customers reduce the total amount they will pay in the long run.
Transparency and Flexibility
At Babu Motors, we believe in full transparency in how our payment system works. We want to make sure that you fully understand how your payments work and how you can save money by paying off your vehicle faster. Our AI-powered support system will assist you in understanding the exact amount you owe, your progress, and how any adjustments to your payment plan can impact your overall balance.
Encouraging Timely Payments
We encourage our customers to set goals and plan their payments carefully. Paying off your vehicle as quickly as possible will save you money in the long term. While our system allows for flexible payments, making timely payments will ensure that you don’t incur unnecessary late fees or complications.
Remember: The earlier you pay, the less you will pay overall. If you start by paying more than the required weekly amount, you could finish paying off your car earlier and save money on the total cost.

q4: what happens if i have only ugx 2 million, 3 million, or 4 million? can i still join the dto program?
a4:
yes, you absolutely can start your journey with babu motors even if you don't yet have the full deposit amount.
we understand that everyone’s financial situation is different, so we’ve created a flexible saving and upgrade path for you:
if you have ugx 2 million, 3 million, or 4 million, you can open a vehicle savings account with babu motors. this account helps you build up your deposit over time. you can deposit money at your convenience-weekly, monthly, or whenever you are able.
once your savings reach the minimum required deposit (either for locally used or japan-used vehicles), you’ll become eligible to choose your car and officially enter the drive-to-own program.
this savings option is secure, transparent, and tailored to help committed individuals gradually achieve their goal of car ownership.
we also allow you to top-up your deposit any time, and our team will guide you step-by-step throughout the process. many of our clients started just like this-with 2 to 4 million-and now they proudly own their cars.

q5: what are the weekly or monthly payments like in the dto program?
a5:
in the drive-to-own (dto) program at babu motors, your payments are fixed and clearly structured to help you manage your journey to car ownership without confusion.
once you pay the initial security deposit (starting from ugx 7m for japan-used vehicles or ugx 5m for selected locally used vehicles), the remaining balance refers to the total car value minus your deposit. that remaining balance is what you will pay in regular installments.
here’s how the installment system works:
the minimum payment allowed is ugx 43,000 per day, which equals approximately ugx 300,000 per week or ugx 1.2 million per month.
no customer is allowed to pay less than ugx 43,000 per day under any circumstance.
however, you are encouraged to pay more than the minimum if you can. paying faster helps you complete your installments sooner and reduces the total amount you pay, since babu motors applies a small daily profit margin over time.
there is no penalty for paying early. in fact, the earlier you pay, the more you save-and the faster you own your car.
we want you to succeed and drive your dream car with confidence. that’s why we make the process transparent, flexible, and achievable for determined individuals.

q6: can i pay more than the minimum required weekly payment to finish my payments faster?
a6:
yes, absolutely. at babu motors, we encourage all drive-to-own (dto) clients to pay more than the minimum required amount if they are able to. the minimum standard payment is ugx 43,000 per day (equivalent to ugx 300,000 per week or ugx 1.2 million per month). however, if you pay more-such as ugx 500,000, ugx 700,000, or even ugx 1 million per week-you will own the vehicle much faster.
why this is beneficial:
the faster you pay, the fewer days we apply our small daily vehicle support fee (usually around ugx 15,000 to ugx 17,000).
a larger portion of your payment goes directly toward clearing your car value.
you save money overall and become a car owner sooner.
early payment is welcomed without any penalties or restrictions.
the dto program is designed to be flexible, supportive, and rewarding for those who are committed and disciplined with their payments.

q7: how long does it typically take to fully own a car under the dto program?
a7:
the time it takes to fully own a vehicle under the drive-to-own (dto) program at babu motors depends entirely on your payment speed and consistency.
we do not set a fixed ownership timeline for every client. instead, we allow you to progress at your own pace-while maintaining the minimum payment requirement of ugx 43,000 per day (or ugx 300,000 per week).
here are some examples to help you understand:
if you pay ugx 1.5 million per month, you may finish within 2 to 2.5 years, depending on your vehicle’s value.
if you pay ugx 2 million or more per month, you can complete ownership in as little as 1 to 1.5 years.
however, if you stick to just the minimum weekly payment, it might take you around 3 years to fully own the car.
we encourage customers to set a personal goal-such as completing payments in 1 year or 1.5 years-and work toward it. the faster you pay, the fewer support charges are applied, and the sooner you get full ownership and logbook transfer in your name.

q9: can i pay more than the required weekly payment to finish faster
yes, you can. babu motors encourages customers to pay more than the standard weekly amount if they are able. the standard weekly payment is usually 300,000 ugx, but if you pay more-such as 400,000 or even 1 million per week-this helps you complete your payment faster and become the full owner of the vehicle sooner.
there is no penalty or restriction for early payments. in fact, it’s a good strategy because the sooner you complete your payments, the sooner you avoid ongoing service charges and tracking costs. our system automatically calculates how much you still owe, and it reduces your balance each time you pay. if you overpay, the extra amount is added to your wallet and used for future deductions.
paying faster also helps build trust with babu motors and improves your chances of getting another car in the future or benefiting from loyalty offers.

q13: can i switch to another car in the middle of the drive-to-own program?
answer:
at babu motors, once you sign up for the drive-to-own (dto) program and take a vehicle, switching to another car mid-way is not allowed. this policy is in place to protect both our customers and the company from potential losses and unfair practices.
when a customer drives a vehicle for several months or a year and returns it to switch to a different one, the original car becomes older and less valuable-both in terms of mileage and number plate age. if we were to give this car to a new customer, they would expect to pay a reduced deposit and complete a shorter term. meanwhile, the customer switching to a fresh vehicle would want to continue paying without placing a new security deposit. this disrupts the business model and causes financial gaps, in short, we don’t support switching vehicles during the dto program because it creates financial complications and undermines the fairness and structure of our service. our goal is to see every client finish the program and proudly own their car.

q14: i saw some people online saying babu motors is a scam or too expensive. is this true?
absolutely not. babu motors is a legally registered, transparent, and highly committed ugandan company that has helped hundreds of people own vehicles through the drive-to-own (dto) program - and hundreds more are currently on track to complete their ownership journey.
unfortunately, there are individuals who spread negativity or misinformation, often without knowing the full facts. in some cases, those who lost their vehicles were involved in serious violations such as:
tampering with the vehicle’s security system, attempting to bypass gps tracking or disable the remote safety features.
using the vehicle for illegal activities like smuggling, theft, or unapproved cross-border movement.
going silent on payments for months, despite several reminders and follow-ups from our support team.
babu motors has never removed a vehicle from someone who was paying on time, using the car legally, and honoring their agreement.
also, people who say the program is “too expensive” often fail to understand how a leasing or asset financing model works. babu motors invests heavily upfront-sometimes ugx 35 million or more-to purchase and insure the vehicle for you. in return, we allow you to earn from it, drive it, and eventually own it.
yes, there’s a daily service fee, but it covers tracking, monitoring, and admin support. if someone pays fast, they actually save money. for example:
car value: ugx 35 million
drive it for 100 days: add 17,000 x 100 = ugx 1.7 million
total paid: ugx 36.7 million
ownership happens sooner and with fewer costs.
instead of comparing with random calculations like “43,000 x 365 x 3”, which assumes someone will pay slowly and drag for years, the dto program actually rewards fast payers with reduced total costs.
we encourage everyone to ask as many questions as they want. and for extra assurance, we have full explanatory videos on our youtube and tiktok platforms to walk you through how dto works, who qualifies, and what to expect.
babu motors is not only helping individuals own cars - we are also proudly creating jobs, boosting uganda’s economy, and operating with a deep sense of fairness, humility, and honesty.

q15: what happens if someone tampers with the vehicle’s security system or tries to bypass babu motors’ tracking features?
tampering with the vehicle's security system is a serious violation of the drive-to-own (dto) agreement and is treated with zero tolerance by babu motors.
every vehicle under the dto program is fitted with advanced security systems to protect both the customer and the company’s investment. these systems help us ensure:
the vehicle is being used legally and responsibly
payments are being made as agreed
vehicles are not used for criminal or unauthorized activities
the location can be tracked in case of emergencies or disputes
if a customer intentionally interferes with or disables the tracking system or any of the vehicle's security features:
the vehicle will be immediately disabled remotely for safety and recovery.
the dto agreement may be terminated, and the customer may lose their right to own the car.
in severe cases, legal action may be taken, and the customer may be reported to law enforcement authorities.
babu motors does not restore access to the vehicle until the full case is reviewed and resolved.
we remind all clients that our goal is not to take back cars - in fact, we deeply prefer that every member completes their payment plan and becomes a proud car owner. however, we must protect the integrity of our system for the benefit of all.
if someone is facing challenges or confusion, the right approach is to contact our support team or visit the office. we’re always ready to assist those acting in good faith. but any form of tampering or dishonest behavior puts the customer's entire investment at risk.

q16: what happens if someone fails to follow the drive-to-own (dto) rules or tries to outsmart the system?
at babu motors, we operate with transparency, honesty, and clear rules that protect both our company and our dto members. while we trust our clients, we've also learned from experience that a few individuals try to misuse the program.
here’s what happens if someone breaks the rules:
using the car for criminal or illegal activity:
if any dto member is found using the vehicle for smuggling, robbery, or other unlawful acts, we immediately revoke their access to the vehicle. we do not allow babu motors’ assets to be used for activities that endanger others or damage our reputation.
tampering with the vehicle’s security system:
all our vehicles are fitted with protective technology. if a customer attempts to disable, remove, or manipulate our tracking or control systems, this is considered a serious breach. the car will be disabled remotely and recovered immediately.
deliberate non-payment or dishonesty:
we provide flexibility - including grace periods and late fee systems - but if someone continuously avoids payment, hides the car, or moves it to another region or country without approval, we take strict action to recover the asset.
misusing company trust:
some individuals may try to show off power or influence, expecting special treatment. at babu motors, all clients are treated equally - regardless of status or connections.
our system is designed to support committed, serious, and honest drivers - not those looking to exploit loopholes. if a member maintains integrity, makes timely payments, and respects the vehicle, they will always be supported. but those who violate our policies are subject to account termination and repossession.
we urge every prospective client to join the dto program with sincerity and a long-term mindset. the program works beautifully for those who follow the agreement - and hundreds have already succeeded through it.

q17: is it true that once i take a car under dto, i can’t use it for personal needs like traveling upcountry or dropping my kids at school?
a:
that’s false. once you take a car under our drive-to-own program, it becomes your daily vehicle - for business, personal errands, school drops, family trips, or upcountry journeys.
the only restriction is: don’t tamper with our tracking system, and don’t use the car for illegal or criminal activities.
apart from that, your vehicle is yours to use freely as long as you meet your payment obligations.


q18: what happens if i get into an accident while driving a car under the dto program?
a:
all vehicles under the drive-to-own (dto) program at babu motors are comprehensively insured through our trusted partner, nic insurance company. this means that in the unfortunate event of an accident, the insurance company will assess the situation and, if approved, compensate for damages, theft, or total loss as per the insurance policy terms.
however, it is important to understand that:
babu motors does not cover or contribute to repair costs.
once an accident occurs, the matter is handled directly between the insurance company and the vehicle user.
the process may involve several steps - including police reports, inspections, and paperwork - which can be time-consuming and stressful.
we strongly advise all dto members to:
drive responsibly and defensively.
avoid reckless driving or taking risks simply because the car is insured.
understand that even after repair, a damaged car may lose value or develop ongoing mechanical issues.
remember: accidents can cause serious injury, loss of life, and unnecessary complications. preventing them is always better than dealing with consequences.
for insurance-related support, you can contact:
madam esther (nic insurance support) - 📞 +256 773 505924
we also assign each customer a dedicated relationship manager or field officer who can guide and assist you in case of any emergencies or concerns.


q19: if my car develops a mechanical problem after taking it from babu motors, will the company help me with repairs?
a:
no. once a customer takes a vehicle under the drive-to-own (dto) program, babu motors is not responsible for any mechanical issues that may arise during the lease period. from day one, the vehicle is leased to you, and it becomes your full responsibility to maintain and repair it at your own cost.
we strongly advise all dto members to:
plan ahead before taking a car by asking yourself: "how will i pay? what if the car needs repairs? can i manage?"
save regularly. for example, if your daily payment is ugx 43,000, you should try to save at least ugx 10,000 daily for servicing, repairs, and emergencies.
drive responsibly and maintain your car well to avoid unnecessary breakdowns.
many mechanical issues arise due to:
late servicing
overloading
rough driving
negligence and poor planning
some customers expect babu motors to solve their personal financial issues or fix their cars when things go wrong. that is not possible. we are not a charity organization-we are a structured business entity that pays taxes and operates professionally.
babu motors made a big investment to get you this vehicle, and now it’s your responsibility to manage it wisely. if you fail to plan, don’t blame babu motors. success in this program comes through discipline, dedication, and financial responsibility.

q21: after getting the car, what kind of support should i expect from babu motors?
a:
once we give you the car, our biggest support is already done - we’ve financed your vehicle and handed it to you so you can earn, grow, and eventually own it. now it’s your duty to pay on time, drive responsibly, and maintain the car in good condition.
to assist you further:
we’ve built an ai-powered system to answer all your questions 24/7 through our website and whatsapp.
we have two separate ai systems - one for new inquiries, and one exclusively for existing drive-to-own members like you.
every customer is assigned a dedicated relationship or field manager for real-time guidance and support.
but support doesn’t mean we handle all your personal issues. if you default, misuse the vehicle, or fail to plan, don’t expect endless sympathy. we are a business, not a charity - we are here to support those who are disciplined, committed, and goal-oriented.
if you’re serious about owning your car, we’re always here to support you within clear boundaries.

q24: can i take my vehicle out of uganda (e.g., to kenya or rwanda)?
no. babu motors strictly prohibits taking dto vehicles out of uganda. doing so is treated as attempted theft. if you attempt this, your car may be repossessed permanently, and you’ll be banned from the program.

q25: can i mortgage or pledge the vehicle to moneylenders or someone else?
absolutely not. mortgaging or pledging a babu motors vehicle is illegal and will lead to permanent repossession. you risk losing everything. such acts are a breach of trust and contract and will result in a lifetime ban from the dto program.

q27: can i give my vehicle out for self-drive or rent it to someone else?
no, it is strictly prohibited. babu motors does not allow any dto vehicle to be given out for self-drive, rented to others, or used for any commercial hire purposes outside your personal use.
we have encountered several cases where vehicles were misused, damaged, or even used in criminal activities such as theft, smuggling, or illegal transport. in some situations:
cars were stolen or stripped for spare parts.
drivers used the vehicle for criminal purposes like robbery or transporting stolen goods.
vehicles were impounded by authorities, including the military, and recovering them became difficult or impossible.
innocent beneficiaries were arrested simply because the car registered under their name was used in crime by someone else.
even if someone offers you ugx 150,000 or 200,000 per day, do not be tempted. once a problem occurs, the responsibility falls entirely on you-not the person you gave the car to.
additionally, if your vehicle is insured for private use and you're caught using it for commercial purposes, such as self-drive hire, your insurance becomes void. in the event of damage or theft, you may receive no compensation from the insurer due to policy violation.
other violations we prohibit include:
allowing unlicensed or reckless individuals to drive your vehicle.
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
tinting front windshields or front windows.
modifying the vehicle with oversized tires or illegal accessories.
our policy is based on trust, but we also strongly advise every beneficiary to use their vehicle responsibly and avoid risky behavior. babu motors is committed to protecting both your investment and our vehicles, and if a vehicle is involved in a crime, we will fully cooperate with authorities and disclose the registered user details.
protect your vehicle. drive it yourself. own it with pride.

q28: can i paint or modify the vehicle i got under drive-to-own?
no, you are not allowed to repaint, rebrand, or modify the vehicle in any way without written permission from babu motors.
all dto vehicles remain the legal property of babu motors until the final installment is paid. that means:
repainting the car, changing its color, or doing any branding (like stickers or company logos) without approval is strictly prohibited.
modifying the body, fitting larger rims or tires, changing suspension, or any performance upgrades are not allowed.
unauthorized tinting, especially of the front windscreen and front windows, is against our policy.
the reason is simple: we want to protect the value, condition, and compliance of every vehicle. unauthorized changes can:
void your comprehensive insurance policy.
make the vehicle non-compliant with traffic laws.
reduce the resale value in case of repossession or early termination.
if you feel the need to repaint or modify your vehicle for a valid reason, kindly submit a written request to our team. upon evaluation, we may grant permission with specific conditions.

q29: can i use my drive-to-own (dto) vehicle for business purposes like uber, bolt, school transport, or airport trips?
yes, babu motors allows you to use your vehicle professionally as long as you drive responsibly and maintain it well. you are free to operate on platforms like uber, bolt, or faras, or use your car for school transport, airport transfers, tourism trips, or other business activities.
we do not prohibit any lawful use, and we encourage you to use the car to support your income and livelihood. however, the key rule is “cars are for use, not misuse.”
we strongly discourage misuse such as overloading, carrying heavy goods like bricks or sand, or driving recklessly, which can damage the vehicle. until you complete the payments and take full ownership, the car remains the property of babu motors. as such, it is your responsibility to drive skillfully, maintain it properly, and avoid anything that might harm the vehicle.
babu motors does not stand in the way of your success-we encourage smart, professional use of the car. drive well, take care of the car, and use it as a tool to reach your financial goals.


q30: can i pause my drive-to-own payment temporarily due to an emergency?
a: no, drive-to-own payments must continue even during emergencies. however, if you have been paying more than the required daily minimum (43,000 ugx) and have built up a positive balance, this surplus can support you during difficult times. for instance, if you've been paying 50,000 ugx daily for three months, you may accumulate a wallet surplus to cover future shortfalls. still, deliberately stopping payments citing emergencies-especially without a surplus-is not acceptable.


q31: can i apply for a second car under the dto program while i’m still paying for the first one?
a: yes, babu motors allows you to apply for a second car if you’re performing well. that means consistently paying on time, maintaining your first vehicle properly, and following all rules. if your track record is strong, and you're willing to pay a new security deposit and comply with agreement terms, there's no restriction on how many vehicles you can own through dto.

q32: what if i lose my job or income source? can babu motors take the car back?
a: losing a job or income source does not exempt you from your dto responsibilities. babu motors is not responsible for your personal income situation and cannot absorb the consequences of your financial setbacks. while we may offer limited support for a few days or weeks if you've built a positive balance, consistent non-payment due to job loss is not an excuse. clients are encouraged to plan ahead, build savings, and manage their finances wisely.


q33: is there any refund if i return the car early?
a: yes, partial refunds are possible under certain conditions. if you’ve paid a 6 million ugx deposit and driven the vehicle for six months, babu motors will consider two components:
security deposit refund: typically 4 million ugx is refundable from your deposit.
excess daily payment refund: if you’ve been paying above the minimum 43,000 ugx daily rate, the extra amount (e.g., 7,000 ugx daily excess) is refundable. however, the standard lease amount (43,000 ugx per day) is considered rent and not refundable.


q34: can i shift from the dto program to a normal purchase model, such as paying in cash or through a loan?
a: yes. you can transition to full ownership by settling the remaining car value. for example, if you’ve been paying 30,000 ugx daily toward the vehicle and 17,000 ugx was babu motors' lease profit, your accumulated payments toward ownership will be calculated. you’ll only need to pay the outstanding vehicle value (excluding any profit already paid) to receive the logbook. however, note that lease profit payments (17,000 ugx/day) are not refundable.

q35: what happens if i fail to bring my car for regular service or ignore maintenance requirements?
a: babu motors expects all dto members to maintain their vehicles in good condition. failure to service your car as recommended-especially neglecting oil changes, brake checks, or tire replacements-can lead to severe mechanical issues. if a vehicle is damaged due to negligence, the cost of repair may be added to your balance, and repeated abuse could result in repossession. proper maintenance protects your investment and ensures safe usage.


q36: can i modify my vehicle, like installing spacers, larger tires, or tinting the windows?
a: no. babu motors discourages unauthorized vehicle modifications. adding spacers, oversized tires, or dark tint-especially on front windows and windshields-is prohibited. such changes can affect performance, lead to legal issues, or reduce resale value. only standard, non-damaging accessories approved by babu motors are allowed during the lease period.


q37: what if my car is impounded by authorities due to a traffic offense or criminal misuse?
a: if your vehicle is used for criminal activity or impounded due to illegal behavior-whether by you or someone you allowed to drive it-babu motors will not protect you. we fully cooperate with law enforcement and will disclose driver details upon request. additionally, you may face suspension from the dto program and be permanently banned from future applications. you are responsible for ensuring your car is used lawfully at all times.


q39: does babu motors allow cross-border travel with my dto car for tourism or business?
a: absolutely not. vehicles under the dto program are strictly prohibited from leaving uganda. whether for tourism, family visits, or business, taking your vehicle across the border (to kenya, rwanda, congo, etc.) is considered a major violation. such acts may lead to immediate repossession, reporting to authorities, and a permanent ban from the program.


q40: what support does babu motors offer if i experience theft, accidents, or insurance claims?
a: babu motors provides limited support in case of accidents or theft. if your car is insured and the incident is genuine, we will guide you through the claim process. however, if the vehicle was being misused (e.g., used for commercial hire under a private insurance policy), the insurance company may reject your claim. in such cases, you may be held responsible for repair or replacement. always drive responsibly, keep your car secured, and avoid giving it to others.

q41: can i buy a car from babu motors in full cash instead of joining drive-to-own?
a: yes, babu motors welcomes cash buyers! we supply all types of vehicles-from small saloon cars to executive suvs, pickups, commercial vans, and trucks.


we maintain stock in:
kampala (uganda)
mombasa (kenya)
japan (for direct imports)

q42: do you offer short-term credit or installment options for vehicle purchase?
a: yes. for those who can pay a large portion upfront but need short-term support, we offer credit-based car sales.
how it works:
you pay at least 70% of the car value upfront
the remaining 30% is paid in flexible monthly installments over 3-6 months
no strict collateral required - just open discussion and a signed agreement
this applies to any vehicle in our uganda, mombasa, or japan stock (see q41 for full vehicle list).
price differences:
full cash buyers often get a better negotiated price

this facility has helped hundreds of satisfied clients own high-quality vehicles without going through banks or heavy paperwork. we are flexible, understanding, and fast.


q43: what if i can’t afford drive-to-own or full cash? do you offer another affordable path to car ownership?
a: yes. if you want to avoid long-term payments or high costs, our savings account program is your best alternative.

q45: why should i choose drive-to-own (dto) instead of buying a car with full cash? isn’t it more expensive in the long run?
answer:
drive-to-own is more than just a payment plan - it is a smart investment strategy for people who understand the value of capital and business growth.
if you buy a car with full cash, you tie down a large amount of money - for example, 35 million ugx - into one asset. but with dto, you can start driving immediately by paying a small deposit, while using your saved capital to invest in a business or other ventures.
for example, if you invested 35 million ugx into a business in uganda, you could reasonably expect to generate a profit of at least 300,000 ugx per day. even after paying 43,000 to 50,000 ugx daily for your dto car, you still retain over 250,000 ugx in daily profits. in this way, you can grow both your income and your assets at the same time.
in simple terms, babu motors invests on your behalf.
we provide the capital, buy the car, ship it, insure it, and register it. you start using the car immediately and pay us in manageable installments, while keeping your own money free for growth. this reduces your risk and increases your opportunities.
